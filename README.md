Register today for this 1-day course: Take Your Groundwater Modeling Skills to the Next Level with FloPy and Python

This course introduces participants to the FloPy python package, which can be used to develop, run, and post-process models that are part of the MODFLOW family of codes (Bakker et al., 2016). Supported models include MODFLOW 6 (Langevin et al., 2017), MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005), MODFLOW-NWT (Niswonger et al., 2011), MODFLOW-USG (Panday et al., 2013), MODPATH (Pollock, 2012 and 2016), MT3DMS (Zheng and Wang, 1999), MT3D-USGS (Morway et al., 2016), and SEAWAT (Langevin et al., 2008). FloPy provides functionality for creating new models as well as working with existing models.

## What is this course about?

The purpose of this course is to present an introduction to python and the pre- and post-processing capabilities of FloPy. The course consists of short lectures and example problems designed to demonstrate the functionality of FloPy. Course topics will include:

* Getting started with python - lists, tuples, dictionaries, numpy, matplotlib (90 min - Mike F.)
* Building and post-processing simple MODFLOW models - Pollock MODPATH model (45 min - Joe H.)
* Developing time varying boundary packages - Pollock MODPATH model (45 min - Chris L.)
* Developing advanced packages - MODFLOW 6 McDonald Valley (for example, newton, SFR, MNW, and LAK Packages) (45 min - Joe H.)
* Advanced analysis with pandas and FloPy - includes loading models - Little Plover (60 min - Andy L.)
* Working with unstructured grids (60 min - Chris L.)
* Automating model runs - streamflow capture (45 min - Joe H.)
* pyEMU demo (30 min - Jeremy W.)

## Who should attend?

This course is suited for MODFLOW users interested in learning how to use python and FloPy to develop and post-process MODFLOW-based models. Attendees will be required to bring a laptop computer (both Windows and Mac operating systems will be supported). python and FloPy software will be provided to class attendees. There will be an optional FloPy developer discussion at the end of the class if requested by attendees.
